# dockit
## A toolbox alternative for Docker
`dockit`, or "Docker Tookit", was inspired by `toolbox` by [debarshiray](https://github.com/debarshiray/toolbox). `dockit` is designed to be simple and more cross-platform than `toolbox`.
### Installation
Copy `dockit` to a location in your path and grant it +x.
### Notes
`dockit` will create a Docker container that maps your home directory to `/root`. At this time `dockit` uses the Fedora image from Docker Hub. If there's interest, flags for other images can be incorporated.
